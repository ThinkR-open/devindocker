title: "Use renv inside Docker container for package development"
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  eval = FALSE
)
```

# First time

- Be sure to be inside your Rstudio project

## You may need {renv}

```{r}
remotes::install_github('rstudio/renv')
```

## Hide from git
```{r}
# Should already be done
# install.packages("usethis")
usethis::use_git_ignore("renv_instructions.Rmd")
usethis::use_build_ignore("renv_instructions.Rmd")
```

## The first time you launch your project in the Docker container, run :
```{r}
renv::consent(TRUE)
renv::activate()
```

## Restore the project from the lock file if any problem
```{r}
renv::init()
```

# Activate cache shared on host
- Store this code in your *project* `.Rprofile` file
  `Sys.setenv(RENV_PATHS_CACHE = "/opt/local/renv/cache")`
- If cache *not* shared with host with option `renv_cache`, then de-activate cache otherwise packages will disappear at next Docker restart
`renv::settings$use.cache(FALSE)`

## .Rprofile content
Store this code inside your project `.Rprofile` file to reduce problems with cache.

```r
source("renv/activate.R")
renv::activate()

# cache ----
if (dir.exists("/opt/local/renv/cache")) {
  # Cache inside the docker container with persistent drive
  Sys.setenv(RENV_PATHS_CACHE = "/opt/local/renv/cache")
  renv::settings$use.cache(TRUE)
} else {
  # No cache
  renv::settings$use.cache(FALSE)
}
```

# During the dev process
## After you updated packages, added new ones or removed somes
If you are satisfied with the effects, run:
```{r}
renv::snapshot()
```

Note that you may want to limit the number of packages added in the lockfile to the one listed in your DESCRIPTION file. To do so, you can use:
```{r}
renv::snapshot(type = "explicit")
```
But in you are in the process of package development, you may want to also share versions of packages like {devtools}, {roxygen2}, {usethis}, {testthat}, {covr}, {attachment}, ... 
As well as {renv} itself.
In this case, you can use the `package` parameter :
```{r}
# Update DESCRIPTION file
attachment::att_amend_desc()
# List dependencies
custom_packages <- c(attachment::att_from_description(),
                     "renv",
                     "devtools", "roxygen2", "usethis",
                     "testthat", "covr", "attachment",
                     "pkgdown")
# Snapshot
renv::snapshot(packages = custom_packages)
```


If you are not satisfied, run:
```{r}
renv::restore() # instead of snapshot()
```

## If you are ready to send your modifications to the git server
And after you ran `devtools::check()`, store your packages list with:

```{r}
renv::snapshot()
# or only those in DESCRIPTION with
renv::snapshot(type = "explicit")
# OR packages in DESCRIPTION + development utilities
attachment::att_amend_desc()
custom_packages <- c(attachment::att_from_description(),
                     "renv",
                     "devtools", "roxygen2", "usethis",
                     "testthat", "covr", "attachment",
                     "pkgdown")
renv::snapshot(packages = custom_packages)
```

## If you updated your branch from the server
There may be new packages needed, therefore run:
```{r}
renv::restore()
```

# If you need to upgrade or downgrade

## Upgrade (or otherwise change) the version of renv
This should normally be automatically done in the `renv/activate.R`, but you can do it with:

```{r}
renv::upgrade()
```

## Upgrade or fix CRAN repository
```{r}
lock <- renv:::lockfile("renv.lock")

# set the repositories for a lockfile
# All CRAN : "https://cloud.r-project.org"
# Fixed MRAN example: "https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/snapshot/2019-08-05"
# Fixed CRAN date example, allowing for Linux binaries: "https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/all/308"
# Latest CRAN repository allowing for Linux binaries: "https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/all/latest"
lock$repos(CRAN = "https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/all/latest")

# write to file
lock$write("renv.lock")

# Update your packages
update.packages()
```

## Downgrade a package to a specific version
Depending on the repos you chose, you may not be able to choose a specific package version.
Instead use:
```{r}
remotes::install_version("golem", version = "0.3.0", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
```


# Use git inside the Docker container
## First time
```{r}
# project config
usethis::use_git_config(scope = "project", user.name = "username", user.email = "user@email.fr")
```

## Use credentials
Must be done for each session as not stored in the persistent drive

```{r}
# Store credentials
my_cred <- git2r::cred_user_pass(
  username = "username",
  password = askpass::askpass()
)
usethis::use_git_credentials(credentials = my_cred)
```

# If you mistakenly installed package from github or forced one version
You may have to be sure to install dependencies from MRAN
```{r}
ll <- list.files(.libPaths()[1], full.names = TRUE)
for (l in ll) {
  try(remotes::install_cran(l))
}
```
